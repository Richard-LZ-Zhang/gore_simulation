How to run the sim, in parallel and in series:
    - blockMesh > log.blockMesh
    - extrudeMesh > log.extrudeMesh

    PARALLEL: if you want to run in parallel, do the following two steps. Else, do the bottom step.
    - decomposePar > log.decomposePar
    - mpirun -np 4 snappyHexMesh -parallel -overwrite > log.shm &
    Note: to view the mesh in paraview, make sure to select "Decomposed Case" instead of "Reconstructed Case".

    SERIES: if you want to run in series (i.e. 1 thread), do this step, and ignore the two steps above.
    - snappyHexMesh -overwrite > log.shm &
    Note: the meshing took my computer around 22 minutes IN PARALLEL with 4 threads.
    I therefore strongly recommend you try using parallel computing, rather than series.
